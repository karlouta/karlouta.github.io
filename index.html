[In our affinity diagram, our group seperated different ideas into five different categories: Advertisement, Startup Thoughts, Product Ideas, Partnerships, and Questions. In doing this, it allowed our group to develop a framework of how we want to design this project, and the stepping stones we need in order to get the final product.] </p>
